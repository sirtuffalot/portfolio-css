<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Olufemi Ishola— a self-driven learner with a growing passion for web development.

  Although I’m still early in my journey, I’ve started exploring what it takes to build real-world applications. I’m especially interested in creating tools that can help people 
  
  Right now, I’m learning how to combine design, code, and creativity to bring ideas to life. I may not have built a full web app yet, but I'm learning every day — and I’m excited about where it’s taking me.
  
  This portfolio is my way of documenting the journey and sharing what I learn along the way.
